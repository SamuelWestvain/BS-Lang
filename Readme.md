# üìú BSLang

**BSLang** is a Gen-Z inspired programming language designed to be expressive, fun, and functionally capable. With meme-driven syntax and semantics, it aims to make programming both entertaining and educational. You might be thinking why to create a language like this:

> "And behold, the Language was made ‚Äî not that it should merely run, but that it should **Vibe**..." 
> ‚Äì *BS Scrolls, Chapter 1: Verse 1*

> Because programming should be expressive. It should slay. It should yeet

## üöÄ Installation Guide for BS-Lang

### üêß Linux

1. **Clone the GitHub repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnomitraSarkar/BS-Lang.git
cd BS-Lang/SCRIPTS
```

Or just download the executable `bs` file manually into the `SCRIPTS/` directory.

2. **Make it executable:**

```bash
chmod +x bs
```

3. **(Optional) Rename it to `bs`:**

```bash
mv bs-v.*.*.*-linux-x64 bs
```

4. **Move it to a system path:**

```bash
sudo mv ./bs /usr/local/bin/bs
```

Now you can run `bs` from anywhere:

```bash
bs
```

---

### ü™ü Windows

1. **Download the `bs.exe` file** from the `SCRIPTS/` folder in the repo or a release.

2. **(Optional) Rename the file to `bs.exe`** for simplicity.

3. **Add the file's directory to your PATH:**

- Press **Win + R**, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter.
- Go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**.
- Under **System variables**, find and select `Path`, then click **Edit**.
- Click **New**, and enter the full path to the folder containing `bs.exe`.

4. **Test it in a new terminal:**

```cmd
bs
```

<b><i>Select the executable distribution according to the platform and version : `bs-[version]-[platform]-[architecture]` </i></b>

### Mac (Coming Soon...)

## Working

`BS-Lang\examples` contain example programs to test and run with, refer below in the docs to get used to the programming language.

To check if working or not

```bash
bs -shell
```

To run bs file

```bash
bs <file.bs>
```

To run bs file and print the ast tree and token associated by parser

```bash
bs -ast -token <file.bs>
```

## ‚úÖ Current Functionalities (aka what Delulu can do rn)

### ‚ú® Core Syntax and Semantics

[View full syntax guide](docs/SYNTAX.md)

- `sigma`: Declare a variable like a sigma male üß† ‚Äî because alpha is too mainstream.
- `cook`: Function declaration ‚Äî chef mode activated üç≥.
- `gyatt()`: Call a function with max rizz üëë ‚Äî ultimate slay.
- `hawk_tuah(...)`: Print it LOUD like your crush just texted back üì¢.
- `rizz_check` / `nah_fam`: If you got the rizz, do this; otherwise, hard pass üòé.
- `flex`: Infinite loop flex session üí™ ‚Äî never stop, won‚Äôt stop.
- `yap i till x to y`: For loop that speaks fluent Gen-Z üß¢.
- `yeet`: Return the value straight into the void üöÄ.
- `skibidi`: End a function with a little dance-off üé§.
- `slay`, `cap`: Boolean truths and lies üíÖ ‚Äî certified facts only.
- `frfr`, `maybe`, `nah`: Logic squad ‚Äî AND, OR, and a full 180 üåÄ.
- `nvm`, `delulu`, `sus`: Null, undefined, and the imposter among us ü§®.
- `on_read{...}`: Comments with ‚ú®aesthetic‚ú® ‚Äî journaling your code.

### üß† Tokenization & Lexing

- Support for numbers, strings, identifiers
- Operators and comparisons
- Keywords and emoji-core logic

### üîÅ Control Flow

- Supports recursion like a philosophy major ü§Ø
- Loops that just keep looping üòµ
- Mutating variables like a shapeshifter
- Full arithmetic + logic support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Is BSLang Turing Complete?

Yes... **in theory**. Like that group project teammate who _could_ do everything, but you know they won't üò©

> "BSLang is **Turing complete** in theory, but in practice she's still working on herself üíÖüõ†Ô∏è." 
> ‚Äì *BS Scrolls, Chapter 8: Verse 8*

So yes ‚Äî we checked the nerdy boxes ‚úÖ but if you try to build Skynet with it right now, she might just `yeet` herself.

## üîß Missing Functionalities for Practical Turing Completeness

### ‚ùó Standard Library (because vibes need functions)

- A standard library is essential to make BSLang usable in practice.
- Math utilities, string manipulation, data structures like lists/maps
- Utility functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `random`
- Standard input/output wrappers
- Time and date support (so we know when to `slay`)

### ‚ùó Arrays and Memory Extended Functionalities

- Hashmaps and Set etc
- Dynamic arrays and nested structures
- `len(arr)` support and iteration

### ‚ùó First-Class Functions Extensions

- Anonymous functions (bonus points for ‚ú® aesthetic syntax ‚ú®) like Lambda function

### ‚ùó Input/Output

- File I/O (optional but üî•)

### ‚ùó Interpreter Runtime Buff

- Remove recursion limits
- Allow deep call stacks
- Add tail call optimization (for the real nerds)

### ‚ùó Error Handling (a.k.a. emotional support)

- `panik` for try/catch semantics
- Null-safe comparisons and default values

### ‚ùó Optional Vibes

- `eval()` for runtime code gen (yes this is chaotic, we support it)
- Garbage collection
- REPL or live console (so you can vibe-test code live)

## ü§ù Open Source Vibes

BSLang is totally open source ‚Äî because gatekeeping isn‚Äôt slay. Contributions are welcome whether you want to fix bugs, add features, or just inject more meme magic.

- Found a bug? Squash it like a cap.
- Got a feature idea? Let‚Äôs manifest it together.
- Wanna vibe with the code? Fork it, slay it, PR it.
